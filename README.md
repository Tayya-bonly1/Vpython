## ✅ Basic Python Syntax

Here are a few key basics to get you started:

### 1. **Print Something**

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

### 2. **Variables**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
```

### 3. **Data Types**

* String: `"Hello"`
* Integer: `5`
* Float: `3.14`
* Boolean: `True` / `False`
* List: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`
* Dictionary: `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`

### 4. **If Statement**

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult.")
else:
    print("You're a minor.")
```

### 5. **Loops**

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 6. **Functions**

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")
```
